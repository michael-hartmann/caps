Testing
=======

Current status:
At the moment we use a handwritten unit testing framework. This framework
woorks fine, but is quite limited.

Problem:
Testing is limited at the moment.

Goal:
Use another unit testing framework, support fuzzy testing and make different
"classes" of tests. For example it would be handy to have fast tests to check
if a change of the source code caused a bug, and also tests that will take a
while, but do a full check.


Drude and generic metals
========================

Current status:
Perfect mirrors and (partly) Drude mirrors are supported.

Problem:
There is no adaptive procedure for integration and no error estimation. There
is no support for real mirrors.

Goal:
Add a integration with error estimation, support real mirrors.


Estimation and extrapolation of log(det(Id-M)) calculation
==========================================================

Current status:
The round trip matrix M is balanced, and the determinant of Id-M is calculated
using a QR decomposition.

Problem:
There is no estimation of the truncation error due to a finite value of lmax.

Goal:
Add estimation for truncation error, support extrapolating.
