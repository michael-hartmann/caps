The Casimir effect
==================

This directory contains experimental data for the Casimir force F and the
Casimir force gradient F' for the geometry of a sphere of radius R and a plate.
The data were measured at room temperature T=295K, the sphere and the plate
were coated by gold. The radii of the spheres are R=10.5µm, R=31.4µm, R=52.3µm,
R=102.8µm, and R=148.2µm.

The experimental data are in the directory experimental/. The numerical
calculations are in the directory numerical/.
