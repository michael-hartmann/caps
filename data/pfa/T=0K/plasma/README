Plasma model at zero temperature
================================

This directory contains data for the Casimir effect using the plasma model
ϵ(ξ)=1+ωp²/ξ² at zero temperature T=0. The names of the subfolders indicate
the value ωp·L/c.

The linear correction θ to PFA can be obtained by a paper of Teo [1]
    E ≈ E_PFA ( 1 + θ_1·x )
where x=L/R corresponds to the inverse aspect ratio.

It seems that the energy allows an expansion in powers of √x:
    E ≈ E\_PFA ( 1 + θ_1·x + θ_2·x^1.5 + θ_3·x² )

Fixed parameters:
    quantity         | symbol | value
    -----------------+--------+-------
    temperature      | T      | T=0
    plasma frequency | ωp     | ωp=9eV
    separation       | L      | ωp·L/c

Variable parameters:
    quantity             | symbol | dependence
    ---------------------+--------+-----------
    inverse aspect ratio | x      | x=L/R
    radius               | R      | R=L/x

The directories data10 and data25 contain a lot of points, the other
directories contain only a few points in order to allow a linear fit to obtain
θ_2 and θ_3.

Programs:
    data.py: Process raw data and output one single CSV (needed for fit.py and plot.py)
    fit.py:  obtain θ_2 and θ_3 from a linear fit
    plot.py: create a plot
