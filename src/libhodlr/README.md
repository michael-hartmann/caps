# libhodlr

This is a simple wrapper for the [HODLR
library](https://github.com/sivaramambikasaran/HODLR) in version
[3.1415](https://github.com/sivaramambikasaran/HODLR/tree/v3.1415) which
implements the calculation of the logarithm of the determinant of a matrix
D=Id-M. The only difference is that `max_tries` in `HODLR_Matrix.cpp` is set
to 200. In the vanilla sources `max_tries=10`. Here is a diff:

The HODLR library depends on Eigen. Eigen is a C++ template library for linear
algebra. In order to reduce dependencies and to improve compability, we include
[Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) in version 3.3.7.

In `tests/` is a small testing program that checks determinants computed by
HODLR with analytical values. The program works as a simple test suite to make
sure that the library is working correctly.
